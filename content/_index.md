Hi! This is Nan. My research focuses on developing scalable
statistical machine learning methods to detect key signals and
reveal meaningful patterns from high-dimensional data.
My [Erd≈ës number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is
[4](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576).

My industry experience dedicates to designing and implementing cloud-based
data analysis solutions for leading pharmaceutical & life science research
organizations around the world. By connecting the dots in product and engineering,
my core mission is to make genomic data analysis
[collaborative](talks/#talk-bostonbiocmeetup)
and [reproducible](talks/#poster-dockflow).

I am an active contributor to the R community,
with 20+ open source [R packages and Shiny applications](software/) for
machine learning, data visualization, and reproducible research. I won the 2018
[John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award](http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/index.html)
from the American Statistical Association for my [R package liftr](https://liftr.me).
