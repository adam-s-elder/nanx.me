Hi there! This is Nan.

My research focuses on developing scalable statistical machine learning
methods to detect key signals and reveal meaningful patterns from
high-dimensional biological/chemical/financial data.
My current [Erd≈ës number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is
[4](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576).

I build open source software for statistical learning,
data visualization, and computational reproducibility.
My most popular R packages include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), [protr](https://nanx.me/protr/),
and [liftr](https://liftr.me/)
([John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award](http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/index.html), 2018).

My industry experience dedicates to building tailored, cloud-based
solutions for the most challenging computational problems
in genomics and precision medicine.
By connecting the dots in data science and product engineering,
my mission is to make genomic data analysis faster, cheaper,
collaborative, and reproducible.
