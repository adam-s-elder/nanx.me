Hi there! This is Nan.

My research focuses on developing scalable statistical machine learning
methods to detect key signals from high-dimensional omics data.
My current Erd≈ës number is
[4](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576).

I build open source software for statistical learning,
data visualization, and computational reproducibility.
My most popular R packages include [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), [protr](https://nanx.me/protr/),
and [liftr](https://liftr.me/).

My industry experience dedicates to building tailored, cloud-based
solutions for the most challenging computational problems
in genomics and precision medicine.
By connecting the dots in data science and product engineering,
my mission is to make drug discovery fast, collaborative, and reproducible.
