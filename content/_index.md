Hi! I'm Nan Xiao, a senior data scientist working at [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/). I have a PhD degree in statistics, and [my research](https://nanx.me/papers/) was focused on developing statistical machine learning methods to analyze high-dimensional data. My Erd≈ës number is
[4](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationFiltered.html?group_target=189017&group_source=1129576).

I'm interested in discovering the connections between things.
I build [software](https://nanx.me/software/) to improve my computational
workflow in statistics and bioinformatics. My most popular R packages include
[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/), [stackgbm](https://nanx.me/stackgbm/),
[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/), [protr](https://nanx.me/protr/),
and [liftr](https://liftr.me/).

I currently live in Cambridge, MA. In my spare time, I enjoy playing squash and [running along the Charles River](https://twitter.com/nanxstats/status/1168690124051423232/).
